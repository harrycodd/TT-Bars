# TT-Bars
TT Bars for time trial bike; pads, extension covers and pole clamps designed in fusion 360. Designed to fit my Dolan Scala handlebars. Possibly custom basebar from previous owner so pole clamps may be unique to the bike, however everything else should be fairly standard. Aero extension covers have been split into multiple pieces for easier adjustability compared to mockup and there is a wahoo mount. As well as the 3d printed parts, I have used eva foam for the pads to make it comfortable to use.

Credit to Wattshop for the pad design. (Haven't released - not sure of laws surrounding this).
